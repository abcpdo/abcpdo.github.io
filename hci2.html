							<h1>Accessible Design is Profitable Design</h1>
							<img src="images/hci2banner.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin:0 auto;width:50%;height:auto;"/>
							<p>Accessible design has historically been somewhat of an afterthought in the physical realm, namely due to the additional cost and design considerations involved. Many, if not most, products simply did not consider accessibility during product development. However, in this software age we live in, the cost/benefit gap of accessible design is closing fast. The cost of incorporating accessibility features into software is relatively low compared to physical implementations, because it is simply adding the software elements and APIs to make the product more accessible. Thanks to the large amount of processing and storage capacity in personal computing devices today, software developers can accommodate improvements for many types of users, while physical products are limited by more constraints. </p>
							
							<h3>Accessibility Features Can Be Cost Effective</h3>
							<p>Apple has made great improvements with their software since the introduction of iPhone OS (now iOS), and now we are even seeing some of that spill over back to their desktop operating system, macOS. Accessible design in software, especially for a general purpose like the macOS interface, can be highly desirable for people whose lives can be greatly improved with such an application of technology. Therefore, implementing accessible software is a no-brainer for companies like Apple, where the potential for increased sales more than offsets the investment made for the research design, and maintenance of accessibility features in their software interfaces. Additionally, Apple can make ads to showcase how their accessibility features can make people’s lives better, which nets them brand “kudos”.</p>

							<h3>Benefiting Everyone</h3>
							<p>As beneficial as these features are in enriching the lives of people with disabilities, perhaps it is more important to consider how these features can “spill over” to the general consumer demographics, to increase the desirability of Apple’s devices for all. Here are some features that have proven appealing to many:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>Reachablility</p>
									<br>
									<img src="images/reachability.gif" alt="" style="display: block; margin:0 auto;width:55%;height:auto;" />
									<br>
									<p style="text-align: center;">The whole screen slides down for shorter fingers to reach.</p>
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>
									<p>AssistiveTouch</p>
									<br>
									<iframe width="560" height="315" style="display: block; margin:0 auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a0IO_tqsO5g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									<br>
									<p style="text-align: center;">A virtual home button exists on the screen and expands to show many buttons.</p>
								</li>
								<br>
								<li><p>Voice Over</p>
									<br>
									<iframe width="560" height="315" style="display: block; margin:0 auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqoXFCCTfm4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									<br>
									<p style="text-align: center;">The system can say content on the screen.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p>These examples all have accessibility roots but have gained widespread appeal with users who want to use their device with one hand, who like the ease of use of having a virtual set of shortcuts, or who are driving their car. Features like these, and other ones like lighting up the flashlight for notifications and allowing the user to customize haptic feedback, enable Apple to build devices that serve specific personas in their consumer base even better, such as a woman with smaller hands who wants a larger phone, or a power user who wants custom shortcuts.</p>

							
							<h3>Accessing Accessibility</h3>

							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehyhFyKXwjc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<br>
							<p>Google Maps’ video about accessible transit routes is another great example of how accessible design can turn into universal design and potentially benefit everyone, which in turn benefits Google’s revenue. While not everyone may be mobility challenged, almost everyone may be pushing a baby-stroller/cart/luggage at some time in their lives. Personally, there have been times in my life (such as after running a half-marathon) where I would have appreciated knowing places where I didn’t need to walk down flights of stairs. By giving people the option of checking for things like this, Google makes their product more appealing to use.</p>

							<h3>Takeaway</h3>

							<p>The takeaway from these examples of accessibility in software, whether if it’s features that allow the software to be used by more people, or software that allow people to make more accessible choices, is evident: companies that incorporate accessible design into their software products can broaden their appeal to not only those who require it, but also their existing users, in ways that can clearly improve their bottom line. Therefore it is only logical that we will see more and more accessibility features show up in software in the future, a win for both the consumer and companies. </p>
